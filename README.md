- [ ] Optimize serialization algorithm.

## üöÄ Get Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Below is a guide on the common commands you might use all throughout the development process. In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs all package dependencies of the app. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed and configured first.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn lint`

Launches the linter against all of the `.ts` and `.tsx` files from the `src/` directory. The project specifically uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the linter and code formatter, respectively.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
